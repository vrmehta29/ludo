# Ludo web app

### Development stack

This is a web app for the popular ludo game with a focus on mobile devices. The preferred frontend development is using **ReactJS** and backend development using **NodeJS**. The database choice is **MongoDB**. Thus, **MERN** stack is being used. 

### Features

The goal is to use client side programming for the game logic. This would let users play the game once it is loaded even without internet connectivity. This would however not let users play online against other users. Online gaming is a distant goal. The choice to select number of players will be given. If the players are less than 4, bots will be used.

### Dependencies

Dependencies are given in the *package.json* file. Please install NodeJS and npm first, followed by all the dependencies.
